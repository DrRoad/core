Welcome to TrafficSense's documentation!
========================================
The TrafficSense project was started as part of the Rochester Institute of Technology Multidisciplinary Senior Design
program. The TrafficSense tools are designed to facilitate simple use of the SUMO traffic simulation software so the
user can focus on optimizing traffic light controls at an intersection.

Making it easier to make intersections better.
